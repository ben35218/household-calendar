// Signal-parity G4 — query-scoped AI context.
//
// The calendar assistant used to ship the ENTIRE decrypted calendar (every event,
// task, chore, and trip the household ever had) to the AI route on every turn.
// This module narrows that to a date window DERIVED FROM THE CONVERSATION, so only
// the records a turn plausibly needs leave the device — the G-phase "minimum
// context is the default" principle, applied to the biggest remaining payload.
//
// Two pure functions (unit-tested, no I/O):
//   deriveAiWindow(texts, now, focusDate?) — cheap heuristics over the chat text
//     (relative terms, month names, explicit years/durations) → a [from, to]
//     window, defaulting to a modest span around "now".
//   scopeCalendarSources(sources, window) — filter the decrypted sources to that
//     window, but ALWAYS keep recurring items (a weekly event started long ago
//     still has occurrences inside any window — dropping it by base date would
//     break recurrence and regress quality). The server then expands recurrence
//     over exactly this scoped set, so far-off ONE-OFF records simply never leave.
//
// Widening is conversation-driven: because the window is recomputed from the whole
// chat each turn, a follow-up that names a later date (or a duration like "next 2
// years") expands the next turn's window to cover it. Recurring items are never
// gated, so recurrence questions work at any range regardless of the window.
