// regain plaintext on the server. This closes that: once a household is
// e2eeActive, a write that carries ciphertext (`enc`) must NOT also store the
// plaintext content columns.
//
// It is deliberately a NO-OP in two cases, which keeps the two lanes the drop
// itself preserves working:
//   1. Before the drop (`!household.e2eeActive`) — the dual-write window still
//      needs plaintext for readiness verification and pre-enrollment reads.
//   2. Writes that carry NO `enc` — the shared-trip (§9.3) and outside-shared-
//      calendar (§9.5) plaintext lanes write without ciphertext so cross-
//      household collaborators (who hold no HDK) can read them; their plaintext
//      must survive.
// The columns nulled are exactly the drop's DROP_FIELDS for that collection, so
// the write rule and the drop can never disagree about what's content.

// the record only to `householdId`. A resource-scoped (`enc.ks` cal/trip) record
