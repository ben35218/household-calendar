// whole household (one access level for everyone), specific members, and
// outside emails (each gets a CalendarInvitation; accepting lands the user in
// `collaborators` with the access their email entry carries).

// Legacy shape note: sharedWith/sharedWithOutside/collaborators were plain
// ObjectId/String arrays before access levels; routes/calendars.js normalizes
// old rows on read (members/collaborators → their historical capability:
// members could edit household events → 'full'; outside was read-only →
// 'view'), and rows rewrite to the new shape on their next save.
