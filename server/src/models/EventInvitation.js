// A cross-household calendar-event invitation, addressed by EMAIL or by PHONE
// (SMS). Sharing an event outside the household is a deliberate step across the
// E2EE boundary. Two snapshot lanes (Signal-parity D3):
//   - PLAINTEXT `event`: for non-account email/SMS recipients (a recipient with
//     no keys can't receive ciphertext) — this is what the emailed/public .ics
//     is built from (scope contract #1).
//   - SEALED `sealedEvent`: when the invited address is an account with enrolled
//     keys, the organizer's device seals the snapshot to the recipient's
//     identity public key (an anonymous sealed box — crypto/openJsonFromMember);
//     no plaintext reaches the server. A lazily-claimed plaintext invite upgrades
//     to this on claim (the recipient re-seals to itself; see routes/invitations).
// The source CalendarEvent is never touched — accepting creates an independent
// copy owned by the recipient, so the snapshot here is the complete contract
// between the two households.
