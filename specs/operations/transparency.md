# Transparency

The **canonical, user-facing** long form is
[`docs/TRANSPARENCY.md`](../../docs/TRANSPARENCY.md) — it is the source for the
in-app Privacy & data section and the website page, and is written for users, not
engineers. It must be updated whenever a change alters what the server stores.
This spec is the engineering pointer + the internal contract it commits us to.

## The server-visible contract (must stay true)

A server (or a valid legal request) can obtain **only**:

- Account identity (email, name, timestamps) and household structure
  (membership, join/leave timing). The household **name** and home address are
  **sealed** (Signal-parity C2) — not server-visible.
- Encrypted records: existence, owning household, create/change time, key
  version, padded size — **never content or type** (opaque store; see
  [platform/data-model.md](../platform/data-model.md)).
- Plan/billing status and AI-usage counts; a device label per session.
- Operational logs referencing ids only (no content).
- The deliberate plaintext exceptions (outside sharing, non-account event
  invitations, AI-call essentials) — only if any exist for that account.

It can **never** obtain record content, locations, attachments/manuals, AI
conversation content, passwords, or any key.

## Change rule

Any PR that changes the encryption boundary, adds a field the server can read,
or adds an external data flow (e.g. a new AI surface) MUST update
`docs/TRANSPARENCY.md` in the same change. Cross-check
[platform/crypto-e2ee.md](../platform/crypto-e2ee.md) and the relevant feature
spec's "Encryption boundary" section.

## Known corrections owed to docs/TRANSPARENCY.md

- The stale "Local-only mode / 7-day cloud purge" retention bullet was removed
  (2026-07-20) — that feature no longer exists in the code.
- The doc still lists the **household name** and task **`nextDueDate`** as
  server-visible; both are now sealed (Signal-parity C2 / D4). Update the
  user-facing wording once the prod re-seal/re-drop backfill is confirmed
  complete (until then the conservative wording is defensible for un-backfilled
  prod households).
