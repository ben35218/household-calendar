# Guardian recovery (dual-control)

## Purpose

Let a user nominate a household member as an **optional recovery backstop** for
their end-to-end-encrypted account, so losing every personal unlock factor
(password, passkey, recovery code) no longer means permanent lockout. Recovery
takes a deliberate **two-person step** — the guardian's cooperation *and* a
4-digit PIN only the user holds ("dual control") — so it can't happen by accident
or by the guardian alone in the moment. It is opt-in, never weakens an account
that doesn't enrol it, and rests on an explicit trust assumption: you pick
someone you'd already trust to see your data (they share the household key
anyway). It is a *convenience* backstop, not a guarantee against a dishonest
guardian — see the trust note below.

This complements — it does not replace — the lighter path already implied by the
key hierarchy: because household members share the HDK, a user who loses their
factors can re-enrol a fresh identity key and have any member **re-seal the
current HDK** to it, recovering access to *current shared* household data. See
[households-sharing.md](households-sharing.md). Guardian recovery additionally
restores the user's *own identity key* (and therefore anything sealed only to
them, and their place in safety-number continuity) under a stronger,
member-can't-read guarantee.

## Why dual-control (and its explicit trust assumption)

At the crypto layer, **whoever holds a key that decrypts your data can decrypt
your data.** A plain "guardian holds your key" escrow therefore softens the core
promise from *"only me"* to *"me and my guardian"* — the app hiding the data is
policy, not cryptography. Guardian recovery accepts that softening **by design**:
you nominate a household member you *trust with your data*, and the recovery
secret is locked under **two locks**:

- the **guardian's** identity key (the member you nominate), and
- a **4-digit guardian PIN** the user sets when arming recovery (distinct from
  the account password).

**Product decision (2026-07-20): the PIN is 4 digits.** With Argon2id it is a
meaningful speed bump for the *online, relayed* path and makes recovery a
deliberate **two-person act** — the guardian alone, an accidental tap, a coerced
guardian, or anyone who only observes the server relay cannot complete it without
the user also supplying the PIN. It is **not** a barrier against a *determined
malicious* guardian: holding the sealed `inner` they can brute-force 10⁴
combinations offline. That residual is accepted deliberately — the guardian is
someone the user already trusts with shared household data. Users who want a
harder guarantee use a different recovery method (recovery code / passkey), which
remain the primary backstops. See Security properties below.

## Cryptographic construction (normative)

Arming recovery, on the user's unlocked device:

1. Let `sk` be the user's identity **private** key (the root that unwraps their
   HDK envelope → all their data).
2. Derive a user KEK from the **4-digit** guardian PIN:
   `K_user = Argon2id(pin, salt)` with a fresh random `salt`, at the **highest**
   Argon2id cost the client can bear (a speed bump only — see the trust note; a
   4-digit space is small enough that offline brute-force by whoever holds
   `inner` is feasible regardless of KDF cost).
3. **Inner lock (user):** `inner = secretbox(sk, K_user)`.
4. **Outer lock (guardian):** `outer = crypto_box_seal(inner, guardianPubKey)`
   — the same anonymous sealed-box primitive as HDK envelopes and device-link.
5. Upload a **`GuardianRecoveryEnvelope`** `{ userId, guardianUserId,
   guardianKeyFingerprint, salt, outer, createdAt }`. It MUST NOT live in
   `wrappedPrivateKey[]` (that array's invariant is "any one factor opens it";
   this envelope is deliberately *not* single-party openable).

The server only ever stores/relays `outer` (and later the re-sealed `inner`) as
opaque bytes. It never sees `sk`, `inner`, `K_user`, or the PIN.

Recovering, when the user has lost every factor (fresh device, signed in but
vault-locked):

1. The recovering device (signed in, vault locked) mints a one-shot **ephemeral**
   keypair and opens a relay slot (`POST /keys/guardian/request`); the guardian
   gets a security-alert push + an in-app prompt.
2. **Guardian leg (needs guardian key only):** the guardian's device fetches the
   requester's `outer` + ephemeral public key (`GET /keys/guardian/requests`),
   opens `outer` with its private key → `inner`, and **re-seals** `inner` to the
   ephemeral key (`POST /keys/guardian/approve`). It **cannot** read `sk`:
   `inner` is still `secretbox(sk, K_user)` and the guardian has no PIN. The
   guardian verifies the requester's **safety number** out-of-band first.
3. **User leg (needs PIN only):** the requesting device polls, unseals to
   `inner` with the ephemeral private key, the user enters the **PIN**, and
   `secretbox_open(inner, K_user)` → `sk`.
4. The device now holds the **original** `sk`, so the identity public key is
   unchanged and the existing HDK envelope still opens — **no re-key or HDK
   re-seal is needed**. The client simply enrols **fresh factors** (new password
   / recovery code, re-add a passkey) via the existing `PUT /keys/factors`, so
   the account isn't left single-factor. (`importLinkedKeyPair` reuses the same
   "adopt a keypair, cache to biometrics, unwrap HDK" path as device-link.)

Neither leg alone yields `sk`: the guardian never has `K_user`; the user never
has `inner` without the guardian. ✔ dual control.

## Behavior (normative)

- Arming a guardian MUST require the user's vault to be **unlocked** (needs `sk`
  in hand) and MUST require setting a **4-digit** guardian PIN with a confirm
  step. The client SHOULD reject trivial PINs (e.g. `0000`, `1234`, repeated or
  sequential digits).
- The guardian MUST be a **current household member** at arm time; the client
  MUST show and have the user verify the guardian's safety number first.
- A recovery attempt MUST alert the **user** (all their devices) and be
  rate-limited; the guardian's approval MUST show the requester's safety number
  for out-of-band verification.
- Disarming MUST delete `User.guardianRecovery` and cancel in-flight requests
  (implemented). Removing the guardian from the household MUST prevent recovery
  through them — currently enforced at **request time** (`POST
  /keys/guardian/request` refuses a non-member guardian); active envelope cleanup
  on member removal is a known gap (see Open questions).
- Recovery restores the same identity key, so the client MUST enrol fresh factors
  afterward (new password / recovery code) so the account isn't left relying on
  the guardian alone. The recover UI prompts for this on success.
- The whole feature MUST be opt-in; an un-armed account behaves exactly as today
  ("lose every factor → unrecoverable").

## Data & API surface

- **Models:**
  - `User.guardianRecovery` subdoc — `{ guardianUserId, guardianFingerprint,
    outer, armedAt }`. `outer` is content-blind to the server; cleared on disarm.
  - `GuardianRecoveryRequest` — the transient relay slot (`requestId`, recovering
    `userId`, `guardianUserId`, `ephemeralPublicKey`, `fingerprint`,
    `sealedPayload`, `status`, TTL-swept `expiresAt`). Mirrors `DeviceLink` but is
    cross-user.
- **Endpoints (`/api/keys`, all `requireAuth`):**
  - `GET /keys/guardian` — the caller's own status (drives the Recovery row).
  - `PUT /keys/guardian` — arm/replace (guardian must be an enrolled household
    member; fires a security alert).
  - `DELETE /keys/guardian` — disarm (also deletes in-flight requests).
  - `POST /keys/guardian/request` — recovering device opens a slot; rate-limited
    (5 / 10 min); rejects if the guardian has left the household; alerts guardian.
  - `GET /keys/guardian/requests` — guardian lists pending requests + the
    requester's `outer` + ephemeral key.
  - `POST /keys/guardian/approve` — guardian posts the re-sealed `inner`; alerts
    the requester.
  - `GET /keys/guardian/request/:requestId` — requester polls; burned on delivery.
  - No `POST /keys/reenroll` — recovery restores the same key, so existing
    `PUT /keys/factors` re-enrols fresh factors (see the flow note above).
- **Client:** `GuardianRecoveryScreen` with `mode: setup | recover | approve`;
  entry points in **Privacy & data** — a "Household guardian" row in Recovery
  methods (status badge), a "Recover with your household guardian" link in the
  locked-state hero, and an approval banner when the caller is someone's guardian
  and has a pending request. `lib/guardianRecovery.ts` orchestrates; no camera/QR
  (the ephemeral key rides the authenticated relay, verified out-of-band by the
  fingerprint).

## Encryption boundary

`sk`, `inner`, `K_user`, and the guardian PIN are **never** server-visible; the
server stores `outer` and relays the re-sealed handoff as opaque bytes — the same
posture as `HouseholdKeyEnvelope` and device-link. Server-visible: that an
envelope exists, which member is the guardian, and that a recovery was requested
(for alerts/rate-limits). Cross-link [platform/crypto-e2ee.md](../platform/crypto-e2ee.md).

## Security properties & caveats

- **A malicious guardian can brute-force the 4-digit PIN offline.** Once they
  unseal `outer` they hold `inner = secretbox(sk, K_user)`; 10⁴ candidates is
  trivially searchable regardless of Argon2id cost. **This is an accepted
  residual, not a mitigated one** — the guardian is by definition someone the
  user trusts with their data (they already share the HDK). Users who need
  resistance to a *dishonest* guardian must not rely on this method; the recovery
  code and passkey are the member-independent backstops.
- **What the PIN _does_ protect** (the honest threat model): it forces the user's
  active participation, so recovery cannot be completed by (a) the guardian
  acting alone or by accident, (b) a coerced guardian without the user present,
  or (c) anyone observing only the **server relay** (which carries just the
  sealed `outer` and the re-sealed `inner`). The client MUST also **online
  rate-limit** recovery attempts per envelope and alert the user on each, so the
  relayed path can't be hammered.
- **In-app copy MUST set the expectation:** "Only pick someone you'd trust to see
  your data" — the PIN is a second step, not a wall against a guardian who
  chooses to break in.
- **No new exposure of shared data:** the guardian is already a household member
  and can already read shared HDK content — guardian recovery adds no read
  access to that; it only adds a *recovery* capability for the user's identity
  key, gated by the PIN.
- **MITM (fingerprint is load-bearing):** unlike device-link's QR, the
  ephemeral public key here travels through the authenticated **server relay**.
  A hostile server could substitute its own ephemeral key so the guardian
  re-seals `inner` to *it* — then brute-force the 4-digit PIN offline. The
  defence is the **out-of-band fingerprint check**: the recovering screen and
  the guardian's approval both show the ephemeral key's safety number, and the
  guardian MUST confirm it matches what the user reads over a trusted channel
  (call/in person) before approving. A substituted key yields a different
  fingerprint → the guardian declines. This must be stated plainly in the
  approval UI (it is, in `GuardianRecoveryScreen` ApproveMode).

## Verification

- The dual-control construction — arming produces an envelope neither party
  opens alone; the guardian leg re-seals without reading `sk`; the user leg
  needs the PIN; wrong PIN / wrong device / wrong guardian all fail —
  `shared/crypto/src/core.test.ts`.
- The client flow end-to-end over a blind relay (arm on the user's device →
  request from a locked device → guardian approve → wrong PIN fails without
  burning the slot → right PIN recovers the exact original key; locked-vault
  guard rails) — `mobile/src/lib/__tests__/guardianRecovery.test.ts` (real
  crypto; the API is an in-memory relay holding only opaque strings).
- The server `/keys/guardian*` relay endpoints have **no integration suite
  yet** — a known defect tracked in Open questions (arm → request → approve →
  finish + removed-guardian rejection).

## Out of scope

- **Threshold (Shamir) guardians** — no single member holds even `outer`; a
  stronger variant to consider later if one-guardian trust is unacceptable.
- **Plain household re-seal recovery** (re-admit a re-enrolled member to current
  shared data) — lives in [households-sharing.md](households-sharing.md); it is
  the lighter, no-PIN path and shares the `POST /keys/reenroll` prerequisite.
- Operator/legal recovery — none; there is still no backdoor.

## Open questions

- **Server integration tests pending.** The crypto core is unit-tested
  (`shared/crypto/src/core.test.ts` — both legs required; wrong PIN/device/
  guardian rejected). The `/keys/guardian*` routes have no integration test yet
  (the sandbox's mongodb-memory-server can't boot here); add one covering
  arm → request → approve → finish and the removed-guardian rejection.
- **Guardian-removal cleanup is passive, not active.** Removing the guardian from
  the household doesn't yet delete `User.guardianRecovery`; instead
  `POST /keys/guardian/request` refuses when the guardian is no longer a member
  (defence-in-depth). Consider an active clear in the member-removal path so the
  Recovery row doesn't show a stale "On".
- **Multiple guardians (non-threshold):** allow arming >1 independent guardian
  for availability, accepting that any one of them + the PIN can recover?
- *Resolved:* PIN length (4 digits); no `/keys/reenroll` needed for this path
  (same-key recovery). Optional future hardening — a rate-limited **server-held
  pepper** (iCloud-escrow style) — would make even a 4-digit PIN
  offline-infeasible, at the cost of adding the server to the trust path;
  deferred under the trusted-guardian assumption.
